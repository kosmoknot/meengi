A memex and logs based journaling system meant to keep track of my life. Still in early development.

Meengi uses a simple static website generator written in C++ that takes markdown format as input.

Inspired from [hundredrabbits/100r.co](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co)

Created for my website [kosmoknot](https://kosmoknot.netlify.app/)
